# 🌐 Personal Web Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This is a simple, clean website that introduces me as an aspiring web developer. It includes links to:

- **About Me** – a brief introduction to who I am
- **Projects** – a showcase of work I've been building
- **Contact** – how to get in touch with me

I'm passionate about building practical, user-focused applications and continuously learning as I transition into the tech industry. This site is my first step into sharing my journey and work with the world.
